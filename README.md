# Bookdrop

## Description

Bookdrop is a personal project — an online bookstore where users can:

- Register and log in to their accounts

- View past orders

- Search for books or authors

- View detailed information about selected books

- Add books to their cart

- Pay securely via Stripe

This project is built using:

- Next.js

- TypeScript

- Tailwind CSS

- Auth.js

- Stripe

- PostgreSQL

It includes custom API routes (via Next.js) to handle backend logic such as user authentication, book detail fetching, cart management, and payment session creation.

Frontend errors are displayed with user-friendly messages, and server-side issues are logged via `console.error`.
